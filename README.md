MAtricks Forge V1

by MA Macro Foundry

MAtricks Forge V1 is a fast utility plugin for grandMA3 that automatically generates common MAtricks patterns and stores them into consecutive slots — saving time when busking or building looks.

This is a V1 fast-ship tool focused on speed, simplicity, and repeatable results.

What This Plugin Does

MAtricks Forge V1:

Takes your current fixture selection

Generates multiple commonly used MAtricks

Stores them into consecutive MAtricks slots

Applies clear, readable labels

Optionally recalls the first MAtricks automatically

No layouts.
No manual math.
No rebuilding the same patterns every show.

MAtricks Generated

Depending on your selections, the plugin forges standard patterns such as:

One-to-One

Left / Right Split

Quarter Splits

Odd / Even

Center-Out

These are created using MAtricks-native parameters (Blocks, Groups, Wings) so they behave exactly as expected inside MA3.

How to Use

Enter:

Base Name (used for labeling MAtricks)
